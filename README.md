# Document_Structure_Analysis
üìå Overview

This project focuses on document structure analysis ‚Äì the task of classifying and segmenting components of a document such as text, tables, figures, titles, and lists. It implements and compares three approaches:

Support Vector Machine (SVM) ‚Äì Feature-based classification

Random Forest Classifier ‚Äì Robust ensemble learning

Detectron2 (Mask R-CNN 50 FPN) ‚Äì Deep learning for advanced layout detection

Trained on the PubLayNet dataset, the project demonstrates the trade-offs between computational efficiency (SVM, Random Forest) and high-accuracy deep learning (Detectron2).

‚ú® Features

Classifies document elements: Text, Tables, Figures, Titles, Lists

Uses both classical ML models and deep learning frameworks

Handles scanned images and PDFs of structured/unstructured documents

Achieves up to 95% accuracy on complex document layouts

Provides a comparative study of efficiency vs. precision

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

ML Models: SVM, Random Forest

Deep Learning: Detectron2, Mask R-CNN, PyTorch

Dataset: PubLayNet (IBM Research)

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

üî¨ Methodology
1. SVM-Based Approach

Extracted area, aspect ratio, rectangularity, contour, and texture features

Trained an SVM classifier for text, table, and figure detection

Achieved ~87% accuracy

2. Random Forest Classifier

Extracted features like area, aspect ratio, perimeter, compactness, and line detection

Ensemble of decision trees reduces overfitting

Achieved ~89% accuracy

3. Detectron2 (Mask R-CNN 50 FPN)

Used ResNet backbone with FPN for multi-scale feature extraction

Region Proposal Network (RPN) for bounding box suggestions

ROI Heads for classification + segmentation (Text, Table, Figure, Title, List)

Achieved 95% accuracy on text, with strong performance across all categories
